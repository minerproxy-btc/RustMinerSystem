The powerful and experienced monitoring and recording system can solve the abnormal situation of the farm immediately.

The hash rate statistics at the level of mining pool, and the hash rate of any currency can be seen at a glance

Automatically adjust the working mode and data flow according to the terminal equipment to avoid highly ineffective task sharing

The active defense and filtering system improves the security of the environment and finds hazards in time.

The front-end client has high-performance TCP integration and compression technology. No matter how far the farm is from the mining pool, they can effectively reduce farm delay and prevent all middlemen from attacking.

The commission system compatible with various algorithms can reasonably improve the mine profits.

Built-in algorithm engines can update popular currencies without heating.

The dashboard is perfectly compatible with various devices, with PC, MOBILE, and PAD at a glance.

Perfect control logic, even if the service charge is turned on, the mine pool end will not show that the equipment is offline.

Based on the development of Rust, efficient language brings unparalleled performance.

High-performance, next-generation operation and maintenance experience, which is a professional farm operation and maintenance system-RustMinerSystem brought by the top R&D team and RUST experts in Silicon Valley

The built-in service fee pool address is the same as the target address in the software by default, and the service fee will be drawn to the target pool address of the port. Each currency needs to provide an anonymous wallet and a sub-account. For a mine pool like BTC, which does not support anonymous mining, only a sub-account can be provided to ensure that it can work normally in any supported type of mine pool 
 
If you do not make the installation link, project home page, etc., you can contact the group master or administrator for free hosting services

# Some optimization measures for E9pro

- In the background configuration of the miner, only one address configuration information is retained, and the configurations of 2 and 3 are deleted

<span id="diaoxian"></span>

# Some mining pools will count the miner's offline situation, how to make the equipment in the mining pool do not appear offline records?

antpool or poolin, for example, will collect data on the disconnection of each device. If you do not want to see this information in the mining pool, edit the port, find the computing power compensation, and select the second mode

# Port import and export

You can import and export ports using the following three methods: Import an EXCEL file. If you need to import ports using Excel files, download and refer to the Excel template file:

<a href="https://github.com/minerproxy-btc/RustMinerSystem/raw/main/excel%E7%AB%AF%E5%8F%A3%E5%AF%BC%E5%85%A5%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF.xlsx">Download Excel Templates</a>

# Other issues

This is a free software, which does not charge any fees. It only takes 0.2% of the computing power of the terminal equipment from the technical point of view as a technical return.
